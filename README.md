# RetirementSimulation
The purpose of this simulation is to model a retirement contribution plan from age 25 to 65 with no previous contributions. 
The goal of this model is to determine the amount needed to invest to have 1.5 million dollars by retirement age before taxes. 
I want to use as realistic assumptions as possible as I am going to use this model for personal financial preparations. 
I chose systems analyst as the career used to determine starting salary. I used a normal distribution to model fund growth.
Accompanying that is a constant fund fee that will incur a small percentage of the fundâ€™s total investment annually to maintain the fund. 
For salary growth, I used a uniform distribution of 0 to 5 percent growth from year 1 to year 10, and then a uniform distribution 
from 0 to 2.5 percent growth from year 11 to retirement. The reason for this is to give a more realistic version of salaries since 
inflation is not included in the salary calculation, even though the growth rate for the investment portfolio does account for inflation.
I set three different investment proportions to determine the minimum necessary investment rate, as calculated as a percentage of salary, 
to reach my goal- 10 percent, 7.5 percent, and 5 percent. Using data table, I ran 100 simulations for each investment rate and gathered summary statistics.
